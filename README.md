Game of Life is a simple "population simulator"

This is a project that was done through a MOOC course (Object-Oriented programming with Java, part II) by University of Helsinki. 
This specific project was the end project for week 11 ( https://materiaalit.github.io/2013-oo-programming/part2/week-11/ ).

As it is a part of the course, it is validated through TMC which runs the tests online, so my project had to be modified in some parts to accommodate the tests so that I would get points for it.

This is how the project should work:

It needs to simulate cells with the following Game of Life rules:

Every living cell dies if they have less than two living neighbours.

Every living cell keeps on living during the following iteration (i.e. turn) if they have two or three living neighbours.

Every living cell dies if they have more than three living neighbours.

Every dead cell is turned back to life if they have exactly three living neighbours.
